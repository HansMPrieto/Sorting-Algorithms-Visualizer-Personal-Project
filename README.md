# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer-Personal-Project

Sorting Algorithms Visualizer that implements the following sorting algorithms:

- Mergesort
- Quicksort
- Heapsort
- Selection Sort
- Bubblesort
- Insertion Sort
- Odd-Even Sort
- Cocktail Sort
- Comb Sort

Below is a random unsorted array:

After using one of the sorting algorithms, it visualizes the sorting process, generating a sorted array:

How to use:
- The controls for the visualization are on the top of the screen.
- Use the "+" and "-" buttons to modify the array length (2 <= array length <= 550). 
- Use the "Generate New Array" button to create a random array of the length being wished to be used.
- Use the "Stop Visualization" button if you wish to stop the visualization while it is running. 
- The other 9 buttons are the sorting algorithms that were implemented in this program. Use those to visualize the sorting process.
- Note: Make sure to have pygame installed in order to run the module.
